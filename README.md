# Monty Hall Simulation
> It's a simulation of the Monty Hall paradox

Im gonna copypaste this from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem#The_paradox) cause I'm lazy, lol

The paradox is:

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Under the standard assumptions, the probability of winning the car after switching is 2/3.

The key to this solution is the behavior of the host. Ambiguities in the Parade version do not explicitly define the protocol of the host.

The Simulation works like this:



## Installation

Only need Python and Matplotlib Library.

To install MatPlotLib: 
```sh
pip install matplotlib
```

## How to use it!

A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._
